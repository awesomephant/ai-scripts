# AI Scripts

## ai2html

Forked from everyone's favourite NYT project.

### Goals

- [x] Use modern Javascript formatting
- [x] Extract NYT-specific code into options (?)
- [ ] Drop legacy options and commented-out code
- [x] Allow exporting to a different volume than the one Illustrator lives on

### Notes

- `create_promo_image` shows a prompt to create a PNG version of the file, seems to be an NYT deal
